# Goals
To enable advanced custom analytics and filters for discovering, researching and exploring anime.

# Code Overview
This scrapes MyAnimeList.net, derserializes the data into objects and publishes the data into a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17KQKFy9o1pPG0Yko2dTYZcRhNSTdNWyI3NLWsJyfqbI/edit#gid=0) with the intent of it being consumed by Tableau or similar data visualization software. I included a [sample Tableau workbook](https://github.com/spencer-shadley/AnimeExporter/blob/master/data/Anime.twb) in this repo. You can also see the workbook published on Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/spencer.shadley#!/vizhome/Anime/UndiscoveredAnime).
